        "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "\n",
        "  To make cleaning data easier and more effective, the idea of data tidying is introduced. The paper claims that tidy dataset are easy produce and work with. The paper also claims that the framework makes it easier to developtidy tools for data analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The tidy data standarda attempts to reduce the time spent cleaning data, while also making the data cleaning process easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  The first sentence means that the structure of tidy data is common across all dataset, but messy datasets can be messy in many ways. So, there cannot be just one ste of instructions that will clean all datasets. The second sentences means that the semantics of variables and observations can be derived from all different datasets through human analysis, but the variety of the structure of these datasets means that there is no one was to derive variables and observations from any given dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Values make up the dataset and are either numbers or strings. Variables contain all values that measure the same underlying attribute. Observations contain all values measured on the same unit across attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Tidy data is defined by each variable forming a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The five most common probleams with messy datasets are:\n",
        "  - Column headers are values, not variable names.\n",
        "  - Multiple variables are stored in one column.\n",
        "  - Variables are stored in both rows and columns.\n",
        "  - Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.\n",
        "  - A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "  The data in Table 4 is messy because the columns are already variables. It needs to be melted, which means to turn the columns into rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Table 11 is messy because it has values as column headers instead of variables. Table 12(a) fixes this my melting all of the days into a single variable called date. Then, to make this tidy, all entries must be attributes and not variable names. So, tmax and tmin become the variables instead of element and value.  \n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The usefulness of tidy data is strictly tied to the tools that it can be used with, and vice-versa. Wickham hopes that other disipline will get involved in the improvement of tidy structures and tools to make the process of cleaning data and other tasks easier."
